**About me** 

I'm a Student at BHASVIC studying maths, further maths, physics and computer science. Im an aspiring mathematician applying to Cambridge and long term I'll want to make a have a career applying the maths to computer algorithms or by becoming a theoretical physicist. Currently while focousing on my A levels, I'm also practicing for olympiads and other competitions to challenge and improve my problem solving and critical thinking. In my first year I've managed to get best in my year group in the senior maths challenge and the British Mathematical Olympiad round 1, getting a gold and a merit respectively, and I've also got a gold in the online physics challenge. I've also competed in a couple maths team challenges (ritangle and the online Oxford maths team challenge where we came fourth in) and these helped me to improve my leadership skills and listening skills allowing me to help our team in the best way possible.


**Projects at college**

The first project we made in groups at college was a system to manage users in 'hotel kashyyyk' : https://github.com/stephane575/Hotel-Kashyyyk

Another project we made in groups was 'animalopoly' which is our version of monopoly but with animals instead of estates : https://github.com/stephane575/Animalopoly

I also made a connect 4 while learning how to code in java : https://github.com/stephane575/Connect-4


**Personal projects**

I made this as part of competing in the 'Ritangle' maths team comptetion where we were advised to use programs and write our own to solve problems. This one calculates possible triples needed for one part of crossnumber we had to solve: https://github.com/stephane575/Ritangle-code
